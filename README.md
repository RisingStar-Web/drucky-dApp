<a href="https://court.drucky.netlify.org/dashboard"><img src="docs/assets/screenshot.png" /></a>

## Quick start

`npm start` will launch the app, configured to connect to our Rinkeby deployment.

For connecting to other chains / deployments, a few useful npm scripts are provided:

- Mainnet: `npm run start:mainnet` will launch the app, configured to connect to drucky Court's mainnet deployment
- Local: `npm run start:local` will launch the app, configured to connect to the local devchain.

Other [configuration options](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) are also available.

### Local development:

In order to start the dashboard locally, you will need to setup a few processes first.
  - Start ganache devchain
  - Deploy contracts to devchain
  - Deploy subgraph instance

 _For a detailed guide on how to achieve this, see more instructions [here](https://github.com/RisingStar-Web/Drucky-dApp)._

You can also setup the [court services](https://github.com/RisingStar-Web/Drucky-dApp), which include some automation for auto-revealing commitments, penalty settlements and heartbeats. In order for auto-reveals to work, you will need also to setup the [court server](https://github.com/RisingStar-Web/Drucky-dApp).

To start populating the court with disputes, you can use the [CLI tool](https://github.com/RisingStar-Web/Drucky-dApp).
